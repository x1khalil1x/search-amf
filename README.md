# Search.AMF - Advanced Music Finder

## Overview

Search.AMF is a sophisticated application that serves as both a simulated search environment and a content platform with integrated studio operations and visual effects. The platform enables users to explore music content through a curated search experience, manage content in a studio environment, and create immersive audio-visual experiences through the visualizer.

## Core Purpose

### Simulated Search Environment
The application provides a controlled search experience that mimics real-world search engines but with curated content focused on music and audio-visual media. Unlike traditional search engines that crawl the web, Search.AMF operates on pre-defined sequences and content, allowing for:

- Predictable search results
- Curated content discovery
- Guided user journeys through "search sequences"
- Demonstration of search patterns and behaviors

### Content Platform
Beyond search, the platform serves as a comprehensive content management system with:

- **Studio Operations**: Upload, manage, and organize video content
- **Visualizer**: Create real-time audio-reactive visual experiences
- **Admin Interface**: Design and manage search sequences and content libraries

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Minimalist Dark Aesthetic
- Black backgrounds with subtle depth through layering
- Limited color palette with strategic accent colors
- Frost/glare effects for visual interest without distraction
- High contrast for readability and focus

### 2. Fluid Motion and Animation
- Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract
- Smooth transitions between states
- Motion as feedback for user interactions
- Animated elements to draw attention to key features

### 3. Spatial Hierarchy
- Clear visual separation between different functional areas
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Strategic use of depth through shadows and overlays
- Intentional information density based on context

### 4. Interactive Feedback
- Hover states with opacity changes for interactive elements
- Visual confirmation of selections and actions
- Animated transitions for state changes
- Consistent interactive patterns across the application

### 5. Modular Component Architecture
- Reusable UI components with consistent styling
- Separation of concerns between different functional areas
- Scalable design system that maintains visual coherence
- Component-based approach for easier maintenance and extension

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js**: App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- **React**: Component-based UI development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions

### State Management
- React's built-in state management for component-level state
- URL-based state for major navigation points
- Controlled forms for user input
- Custom hooks for shared functionality

## Firebase Integration

The application is prepared for integration with Firebase to manage sequences and visualizer data. The following Firebase services are utilized:

### Firestore Database
- Stores sequence data including steps, results, and metadata
- Manages visualizer presets, parameters, and user-created visualizations
- Handles user preferences and settings

### Firebase Storage
- Stores media assets including thumbnails, audio files, and video content
- Manages user-uploaded content for visualizers and sequences

### Firebase Authentication
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Manages user roles and permissions

### Integration Points

The application is structured to interact with Firebase through service modules:

- `lib/firebase/config.ts`: Firebase initialization and configuration
- `lib/firebase/services/sequence-service.ts`: Functions for managing sequence data
- `lib/firebase/services/visualizer-service.ts`: Functions for managing visualizer data
- `lib/firebase/firebase-provider.tsx`: React context provider for Firebase services

To use Firebase services in components:

\`\`\`tsx
import { useFirebase } from '@/lib/firebase/firebase-provider';

function MyComponent() {
  const { sequenceService, visualizerService } = useFirebase();
  
  const loadSequences = async () => {
    const sequences = await sequenceService.getAllSequences();
    // Use sequences data
  };
  
  // Component implementation
}
\`\`\`

### Data Models

The application uses TypeScript interfaces to define the structure of data:

- `types/sequence.ts`: Defines the structure of sequence data
- `types/visualizer.ts`: Defines the structure of visualizer data

These interfaces ensure type safety when working with Firebase data throughout the application.
